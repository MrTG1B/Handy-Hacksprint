# 🦾 Affordable & Functional Upper Limb Prosthetic Terminal Device  

### Development of an Affordable and Functional Upper Limb Prosthetic Terminal Device for Partial Hand Amputees  

This project aims to develop a **cost-effective, mechanically operated prosthetic terminal device (hand)** for upper limb amputees — bridging the gap between **high-cost myoelectric prostheses** and **low-function body-powered devices**.  

A large number of patients in India, especially in **rural and semi-urban regions**, remain underserved due to the lack of affordable and functional prosthetic devices.  
This project addresses that need directly.

## 🎯 The Problem  

High-cost myoelectric prostheses are **financially inaccessible** for many, while **basic body-powered hooks** offer limited functionality and cosmetic appeal.  
There is a significant need for a device that is:  

- 💸 **Affordable:** Accessible to patients in low-resource settings.  
- 🧠 **Functional:** Capable of performing daily tasks reliably.  
- 🤲 **Intuitive:** Easy to operate and control.  
- ⚙️ **Robust:** Durable, water-resistant, and easy to maintain.

## 💡 Our Solution  

The proposed device combines **mechanical simplicity** with **modern, cost-effective technology**.  
It is designed to be lightweight, easily repairable, and compatible with average anthropometric measurements of the human hand.  

### 🔧 Key Innovations  

#### 1. Affordable Control System  
- Integration of **cost-effective EMG (electromyography) sensors** for intuitive, muscle-based control.  
- A **smartphone app (via Bluetooth)** enables easy calibration, grip pattern selection, and fine-tuning.  
- This **hybrid approach** provides functionality similar to advanced myoelectric systems—without the high cost.  

#### 2. Servo Motor-Driven Gear System  
- A **servo motor-based gear drive** ensures strong and reliable grip control.  
- Enables secure handling of everyday items like utensils, bottles, and light tools.  

#### 3. Cost-Effective Manufacturing  
- Fabricated using **lightweight, locally available materials** and **basic manufacturing techniques**.  
- Designed for **easy repairs** and **affordable production** at scale.
